Project Title: Next Word Prediction Using LSTM
Project Summary
This project is focused on building a deep learning model capable of predicting the next word in a sequence of words using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The LSTM model is particularly well-suited for handling sequence prediction problems due to its ability to maintain context over longer sequences. The project follows these key steps:

Data Acquisition: The text from Shakespeare's Hamlet serves as the dataset for training the model. This literary work offers a rich and challenging dataset for building a next-word prediction model.

Data Preprocessing: The text data is first tokenized and then transformed into sequences of words. These sequences are padded to ensure uniform input length, which is crucial for training LSTM networks. The data is subsequently split into training and testing sets.

Model Construction: The LSTM-based model is developed with an embedding layer to convert words into dense vectors, followed by two LSTM layers that capture the sequential patterns, and a dense output layer with a softmax activation to generate the probability distribution for the next word.

Model Training: The model is trained using the preprocessed sequences. Early stopping is incorporated to monitor validation loss, ensuring that training halts when no further improvement is detected, thereby preventing overfitting.

Model Evaluation: To assess the model's performance, its ability to predict the next word is evaluated using various example sentences, testing how accurately it captures the context.

Deployment: Finally, the model is integrated into a user-friendly Streamlit web application, allowing users to input text sequences and receive predictions for the next word in real-time.
